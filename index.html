          <p>Anime and manga have experienced significant global growth, becoming mainstream<br /> 
            forms of entertainment beyond Japan. This is due to the<br /> 
            rise of streaming services, the rise of social median and<br /> 
            good animated content being made.<br /> 
            <br />
            The choropleth map showcases an <b>Anime Popularity Interest score</b> from<br />  
            <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/">world population review</a> which is numbers that represent the popularity<br /> 
            of anime as a search term in Google in each<br /> 
            country, with 100 being the highest interest in the past<br /> 
            12 months. Numbers are computed in relation to the total<br />  
            number of searches in each country rather than total global<br /> 
            searches. This prevents distortion due to the relative population sizes<br /> 
            of each country. <br />
            <br />
            As you can see with the map Japan has an<br /> 
            extremely high score of <b>80</b> and interestingly countries in the<br /> 
            middle east and south america also has a relatively high<br /> 
            score such as Yemen with a score of <b>100</b> therefore<br />
            as seen in the choropleth below anime and manga have<br />
            truly gone international.

          <p>
            The rating system in anime, categorizes content based on
            its suitability for different audiences, considers factors
            like violence, language, and mature themes and determines
            who can watch what<br />
            <br />
            In the scatter plot below, anime titles are plotted with their average user
            scores of the series on the x-axis and the number of members (fans) on the
            y-axis and as the size, which is scaled logarithmically. Each point's color
            represents its rating category (such as <b>G</b>, <b>PG</b>, <b>PG-13</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>Rx</b>, <b>Unknown</b>).<br />
            <br />
            The graph displays that anime across all rating
            categories can achieve high average scores and amass large
            fanbases. This suggests that while ratings guide viewers on
            content appropriateness, they do not necessarily predict an
            anime's popularity or quality.<br /><br /> The diverse distribution
            highlights that audiences appreciate a wide range of content,
            and factors like storytelling, character development, and
            animation quality significantly influence an anime's reception
            regardless of its rating. Also Fan bases tend to vary more
            as <b>G</b> to <b>PG</b> series have far more reach.

            Users completion and dropping off of anime series and specifically
            how users interact with shows are important to Understanding
            what is important for consumers and why certain consumers
            consume certain genres. 
            <br/><br />
            However it is important to metion that certain series may have
            skewed results. This is due to the fact certain series
            and genres have less episodes when compared to other 
            genres. Also certain genres are just more common than others
            so they may have a more even distribution of shows in
            quality when compared to other genres and then due to how
            My Anime List (MAL) works certain genres are going to be logged on 
            by viewers compared to others.
            <br/><br />
            So for the barbell graph on the x-axis, various anime genres are listed,
            while the y-axis represents the number of users. For each
            genre, two key data points are plotted: the number of
            users who have <b>completed</b> shows (blue points) and those who
            have <b>dropped</b> shows (red points). A gray line connects these
            points for each genre, visually illustrating the disparity
            between <b>completion</b> and <b>drop</b> rates. Additionally, horizontal
            dashed lines indicate the average number of <b>completions</b> (blue)
            and <b>drops</b> (red) across all genres, serving as benchmarks for
            comparison.
            <br />
            <br />
            Analyzing the visualization, we observe that genres such as
            Thriller, and Psychological exhibit significantly higher
            completion rates compared to drop rates, with blue points well
            above the average completion line and red points somewhat higher than the
            average drop line. This suggests that series within these genres
            are particularly engaging, sustaining viewer interest through to
            the end. The substantial gap between completed and dropped counts
            indicates strong viewer retention, overall views and satisfaction. In contrast,
            genres like Kids and Music show a narrower gap between
            completion and drop rates. This could imply that anime in
            these genres may not consistently meet viewer expectations or cater
            to a more niche audience, resulting in higher drop rates. Understanding
            these patterns is crucial for understanding what generally are good series 
            genres to view.

            Popularity of Generes are important especially in anime
            which has extreme variety and their own special genres such as 
            <b>Shounen</b> which is typically young male oriented action
            or <b>Slice of Life</b> which is just simple drama. These genres can give
            a view of what is in and what isn't and what type of shows are valued.
            <br /><br />
            On the x-axis, we have the average
            user score for each genre, reflecting the overall
            quality as rated by viewers, while the y-axis
            represents the average popularity rank, with lower
            numbers indicating higher popularity among fans.
            Each bubble in the scatter plot corresponds to a
            genre, where the size of the bubble indicates the
            number of anime titles within that genreâ€”the larger
            the bubble, the more anime it contains.
            <br /><br />
            From the visualization, we observe <b>Thriller</b> has the
            highest score, <b>Dementia</b> weirdly the most popular genre
            and <b>Action</b> containing the most animes. It seems that more
            niche and smart series are popular and score well.

            Whilst the Big Three are not in any way
            representative of all anime, they do give basic
            guidelines to how most anime works and as such
            provide an overview.
            <br /><br />
            The Big Three refers to the series One Piece, Naruto,
            and Bleach. These series may be somewhat old now as all
            are completed but are still the most popular animes for
            many people. Thus, the graph shows the average time per
            chapter each took throughout their series and gives an
            overview of how animes are adapted.
            <br /><br />
            The line graph shows on the x-axis the chapters and then on the
            y-axis is the minutes per chapter for those chapters. Thus we see
            all were trending to higher minutes per chapter but are very uneven
            overall.

            Both One piece and Bleach have their TV series VS their Manga mapped
            on gantt charts as to see how these series are famously stalled to keep pace
            with the manga.
            <br /><br />
            Context is that the manga for these series did not stop whilst the series was being produced
            so the Tv version's are often stilted with pacing issues and filler anime which is seen within both graphs.
            However it is impressive to see that the TV and Manga for both stay apace with each other relatively well.
            <br /><br />
            Overall these graphs show the breadth of people who watch these shows. The diversity in audience
            and in genres is impressive and also the weird politics that permeate anime such as in the so called
            big three defines this weird and popular hobby, that hopefully more would enjoy.
