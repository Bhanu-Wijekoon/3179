      <h2 class="sub-title">Brief Overview of Smoking</h2>
      <p>Smoking is a global health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. 
        It is a leading cause of preventable diseases and premature deaths. 
        The prevalence of smoking varies significantly from one country to another, 
        with different cultural, economic, and social factors contributing to these differences. 
        While smoking rates have declined in some regions due to anti-smoking campaigns and awareness programs, 
        in other areas, the habit remains widespread.</p>

              including cardiovascular diseases, 
              respiratory problems, and various forms of cancer. 
              Efforts to reduce the number of smokers and promote smoking cessation are crucial in the fight against tobacco-related health problems.
              <br>
              <br>
              Understanding the prevalence and distribution of smokers <b>around the world</b> is essential for crafting effective public health policies and interventions. 
              It's not only about the number of smokers but also about addressing the underlying factors that drive this <b>global health challenge</b>.

              Daily smoking refers to the habit of consuming <b>tobacco products on a regular basis</b>,

              This form of smoking is often associated with addiction to nicotine, 
              a highly addictive substance found in tobacco. Daily smoking can have serious health consequences, 
              as it increases the risk of various diseases, including <b>lung cancer</b>, <b>heart disease</b>, 
              and <b>respiratory disorders</b>.

              <br>
              It also poses economic and social challenges for individuals and communities. 
              Efforts to reduce <b>daily smoking rates</b> involve public health campaigns, smoking cessation programs, 
              and policies aimed at discouraging this harmful habit.

              Smoking is a global issue with far-reaching economic consequences. 
              One of the factors influencing smoking prevalence is a country's Gross Domestic Product (<b>GDP</b> per capita) which has 
              the mean <span style="color: red;"><b>gdp per capita</b></span> in red. 
              Research has shown that in countries with higher <b>GDP</b> per capita, smoking rates tend to be lower.
              <br>
              <br>
              Economically developed nations often have better healthcare infrastructure, education systems, and access to information, 
              which can contribute to increased awareness of the harmful effects of smoking. 
              Additionally, higher <b>GDP</b> per capita can lead to better healthcare policies, 
              including anti-smoking campaigns and increased taxes on tobacco products, 
              making smoking less affordable and less attractive.
              <br>
              <br>
              Conversely, lower <b>GDP</b> per capita countries may have higher smoking rates due to a lack of resources for public health 
              initiatives and less stringent tobacco control policies.

              Unemployment rates can have a significant impact on <b>smoking habits</b> within a population. As you can
              see the mean <span style="color: red;"><b>unemployment rate</b></span> is in red to show how
              <b>Economic stress</b> and <b>job uncertainty</b> can contribute to increased <b>smoking rates</b>, 
              as individuals may turn to cigarettes as a <b>coping mechanism</b> during difficult times.
              <br>
              <br>
              Higher <b>unemployment rates</b> often result in reduced access to healthcare services and resources for smoking cessation, 
              making it challenging for those who wish to quit. 
              Additionally, individuals facing <b>unemployment-related stress</b> may be more prone to smoking as a means of managing anxiety.
              <br>
              <br>
              It's important to recognize this relationship as a public health concern, 
              as it underscores the need for targeted anti-smoking campaigns and support for individuals affected by <b>unemployment</b>. 
              Understanding the interplay between economic factors and smoking behavior is essential in developing effective strategies 
              for reducing smoking rates in society.

                Smoking habits vary between genders, with distinct patterns of tobacco consumption among <b>men</b> and <b>women</b> worldwide. Historically, smoking was more prevalent among <b>men</b>; however, the gap has significantly narrowed in recent decades.
                <br>
                <br>
                Traditionally, <b>men</b> had higher smoking rates, especially in the mid-20th century. This trend was often influenced by cultural and societal factors. In some regions, smoking was associated with masculinity. Over the years, there has been a global effort to reduce <b>male</b> smoking rates through awareness campaigns and tobacco control measures. These initiatives have led to a decline in male smoking rates in many countries.
                <br>
                <br>
                The prevalence of <b>female</b> smokers has been rising, particularly in response to changing social norms and marketing strategies. Smoking among <b>women</b> was once stigmatized in many cultures, but this perception has shifted. The tobacco industry has heavily targeted <b>female</b> consumers, promoting smoking as a symbol of empowerment and liberation. However, this change comes with serious health risks for <b>women</b>.
                <br>
                <br>
                Both <b>male</b> and <b>female</b> smokers face severe health risks, including heart disease, respiratory issues, and various cancers. Smoking during pregnancy can lead to complications and harm the developing fetus. It is important for both genders to be aware of the consequences of smoking and seek support to quit this harmful habit.
                <br>
                <br>
                Efforts to combat smoking involve addressing gender-specific influences, tailoring anti-smoking campaigns, and promoting healthier lifestyle choices for all individuals, regardless of their gender.

                In countries like <b>Sweden</b>, you'll find a relatively low prevalence of cigarette smoking. This is largely due to the popularity of snus, a smokeless tobacco product. <b>Sweden's </b>approach to harm reduction has been successful in reducing the number of cigarette smokers.
                <br>
                <br>
                In contrast, countries like <b>Chile</b> have high smoking rates, especially among men. Factors like the affordability of cigarettes, lack of strict regulations, and cultural acceptance of smoking contribute to this trend. <b>Chile</b> faces a significant public health challenge in addressing smoking-related issues.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, most <b>lower GDP countries</b> seem to on average have extremely small number of smokers among them. Whilst this can be explained by economic factors they may be also availability.
