        <h1>Insights into Anime and manga</h1>
        <p>Anime and manga have experienced significant global growth, 
          becoming mainstream forms of entertainment beyond Japan. The 
          proliferation of streaming services and digital platforms has 
          made these mediums more accessible worldwide, leading to a 
          diverse and expanding international fanbase.</p>

        <h2>Ratings in anime</h2>
        <p>The rating system in anime categorizes content based on 
          its suitability for different audiences, considering factors 
          like violence, language, and mature themes. In the provided 
          scatter plot, anime titles are plotted with their average user 
          scores on the x-axis and the number of members (fans) on the 
          y-axis, which is scaled logarithmically. Each point's color 
          represents its rating category (such as G, PG, PG-13, R, etc.), 
          and the size indicates the popularity based on membership.

          From the graph, we observe that anime across all rating 
          categories can achieve high average scores and amass large 
          fanbases. This suggests that while ratings guide viewers on 
          content appropriateness, they do not necessarily predict an 
          anime's popularity or quality. The diverse distribution 
          highlights that audiences appreciate a wide range of content, 
          and factors like storytelling, character development, and 
          animation quality significantly influence an anime's reception 
          regardless of its rating.</p>

        <h2>Completion and Dropping series</h2>
        <p>The graph titled "Completed vs Dropped Shows by Genre" 
          offers valuable insights into how anime viewers interact 
          with different genres in terms of completion and drop 
          rates. On the x-axis, various anime genres are listed, 
          while the y-axis represents the number of users. For each 
          genre, two key data points are plotted: the number of 
          users who have completed shows (blue points) and those who 
          have dropped shows (red points). A gray line connects these 
          points for each genre, visually illustrating the disparity 
          between completion and drop rates. Additionally, horizontal 
          dashed lines indicate the average number of completions (blue) 
          and drops (red) across all genres, serving as benchmarks for 
          comparison.

          Analyzing the visualization, we observe that genres such as 
          Action, Adventure, and Fantasy exhibit significantly higher 
          completion rates compared to drop rates, with blue points well 
          above the average completion line and red points far below the 
          average drop line. This suggests that series within these genres 
          are particularly engaging, sustaining viewer interest through to 
          the end. The substantial gap between completed and dropped counts 
          indicates strong viewer retention and satisfaction. In contrast, 
          genres like Horror and Psychological show a narrower gap between 
          completion and drop rates, with red points closer to or even 
          exceeding the average drop line. This could imply that anime in 
          these genres may not consistently meet viewer expectations or cater 
          to a more niche audience, resulting in higher drop rates. Understanding 
          these patterns is crucial for content creators and distributors, as it 
          highlights the importance of genre-specific strategies to enhance 
          viewer engagement and reduce drop-offs.</p>

          <h2>Popularity of Genre's</h2>
          <p>"Genre's by Popularity" provides a visual analysis 
            of how different anime genres perform in terms of 
            average user scores and popularity rankings within 
            the community. On the x-axis, we have the average 
            user score for each genre, reflecting the overall 
            quality as rated by viewers, while the y-axis 
            represents the average popularity rank, with lower 
            numbers indicating higher popularity among fans. 
            Each bubble in the scatter plot corresponds to a 
            genre, where the size of the bubble indicates the 
            number of anime titles within that genreâ€”the larger 
            the bubble, the more anime it contains. From the 
            visualization, we observe that genres positioned 
            towards the lower right quadrant, such as Action 
            and Adventure, not only have higher average scores 
            but also enjoy greater popularity, signifying a strong 
            positive reception and widespread appeal. Conversely, 
            genres located higher up or towards the left may have 
            lower popularity or user scores, suggesting niche 
            interest or potential areas for content improvement. 
            The black cross marks the overall average score and 
            popularity across all genres, serving as a benchmark 
            to identify which genres perform above or below the 
            median. This graph effectively highlights the correlation 
            between genre prevalence, viewer satisfaction satisfaction, 
            and popularity, offering valuable insights for creators and 
            enthusiasts alike.

        <h2>Popularity of Genre's</h2>
          <p> Whilst the big Three are not in any way
            representative of all anime they do give basic
            guidelines to how most anime works and as such
            give an overview.
            
            The big Three refers to the series One Piece, Naruto
            and Bleach these series may be somewhat old now as all
            are completed but are still the most popular animes for
            most people. Thus the graph shows the average time per 
            chapter each took through out their series and give an 
            overview of how animes are adapted.
